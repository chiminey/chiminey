Creating a smart connector
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Creating a smart connector involves completing three tasks:

  - providing the core functionality of the smart connector,
  - attaching resources and optional non-functional properties, and
  - registering the new smart connector with the Chiminey server.

..
  When a new smart connector is created, one or more of the predefined  stages are  updated,
  and/or new stages are added. All in all, creating a smart connector involves

    #. customising existing and/or adding new stages as needed,

    #. defining the smart connector based on these stages, and

    #. registering the smart connector within Chiminey.

:ref:`Various examples <examples>` are given to show how a smart connector is created.

..
  These examples also explain
  how  features, such as  data curation and parameter sweep,
  can be included within a smart connector definition.
