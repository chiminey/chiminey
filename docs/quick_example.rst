Quick Example: The Unix Random Number Smart Connector
=====================================================

In this example, we create a basic smart connector that generates two
random numbers on a  unix machine, saves the numbers to a file, and then transfers the file
to a provided output location.  The unix machine must have ssh service  enabled.

This smart connector has already been discussed in <create_sc>.
